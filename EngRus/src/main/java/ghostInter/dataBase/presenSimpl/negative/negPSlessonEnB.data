This thing doesn’t interest me
These things don’t attract me
That thing doesn’t seem interesting
Those things don’t seem strange
Those lessons don’t seem useful
These lessons seem very useful
That method doesn’t help
This method really helps
My brother doesn’t want to think about his future
My sister doesn’t know this person
My friends don’t recommend this hotel
His son doesn’t want to become a doctor
Her daughter doesn’t want to study there
His parents don’t feel happy
This person doesn’t try to change his life
My boss doesn’t see her
My partner doesn’t know him
My friend and I don’t call them
Our teacher doesn’t believe us
He thinks money doesn’t bring people happiness
She thinks money doesn’t make people happy
I want to make you happy
I don’t know
We don’t understand
You don’t try to learn English
They don’t help me
I agree with you
I don’t agree with you
I don’t like it
I don’t want to study there
